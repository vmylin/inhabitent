# RED Starter

A WordPress starter theme for RED Academy students, forked from Underscores.

## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Rename the `redstarter-master` directory

Make sure that the theme directory name is project appropriate!

### 3. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 4. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).

# Inhabitent Project

This project teaches us how to create a custom WP Theme.

## Technologies used

1. HTML
1. CSS
1. PHP
1. WP
1. jQuery(once I add the search function)

### Challenges 

I found this project challenging because it is my first time creating custom WP theme and also using PHP (which we learn 2 weeks ago). I found that searching for the right WP functions to use is quite difficult because I do not know what most of the functions do.
